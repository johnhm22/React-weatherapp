How does CitySearchForm work?
calls function with api for backend which, in turn, calls api for weatherApi
weatherApi returns weather data to backend which returns data to function in react component
CitySearchForm is a component in the BrowserRouter list in App.js
It has two props; a function for today's weather and a function for the 5-day foecast



App.js
Components:
i). CitySearchForm.js (props: function for today's weather; function for forecast weather)
ii). Today.js (props: state for today's weather)
iii). Forecast.js (props: state for 5-day forecast weather)

Functions:
i). Today function calls backend api for today's weather, passing in the city name as an argument
ii). Forecast function calls backend api for 5-day weather, passing in the city name as an argument

State:
i). State for today's weather
ii). State for 5-day forecast weather


CitySearchForm.js (home page) has two buttons; today's weather and 5-day forecast
Each will call a different handleFunction
One handleFunction will execute the function that calls the api for today's weather. It will then render the Today.js component.
Another handleFunction will execute the function that calls the api for the 5-day forecast. It will then render the Forecast.js component.
Note: the functions (today and 5-day) which call the api will be passed from App.js as props

Today.js
Receives, as a prop, details of today's weather
Renders a page to display the weather
Has two buttons:
i). One button will render CitySearchForm.js component so the user can choose another city
ii). A second button to render Forecast.js for the defined city

Forecast.js
Receives, as a prop, details of the 5-day forecast
Renders a page to display the 5-day forecast
Also has a button to render CitySearchForm.js component


BACKEND




today's weather function is defined in App.js and passed into CitySearchForm as a prop
When form containing city name is submitted this will execute a handleFunction which will execute
the function to populate the state for today's weather held in App.js. This handle function will then render the component
for today's weather using navigate('./today')

Forecast.js is also shown in BrowserRouter list of components in App.js and state of 5-day weather is passed in as a prop
